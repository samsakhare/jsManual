    <h2>Coding Challenge #2</h2>
    Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
    improve it.
    <h3>Your tasks:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The
        message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is
        higher than Mark's!"
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs.
        Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Hint:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use an if / else statement</li>
      <li>also use string literals</li>
    </ul>
    GOOD LUCK
