    <h2>Coding Challenge #1</h2>
    Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
    calculated using the formula:
    <pre>
            BMI = mass / height ** 2 
            BMI = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter)
    </pre>
    <h3>Your tasks:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables</li>
      <li>
        Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
        versions)
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
        whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Test data:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and
        is 1.95 m tall.
      </li>
      <li>
        Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and
        is 1.76 m tall.
      </li>
    </ul>
    GOOD LUCK
